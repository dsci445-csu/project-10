Topic Proposal and Suggestions: 
  - Approved of both topics, biggest factor is going to be which proposal has an easier, and more efficient way to collect the data.
        The semester is coming to an end. So this is vital for the efficiency of our project.
  - Ways to succeed: 
      We need to provide diverse models that we were taught throughout the semester
      If we impliment different models, we need to explain exactly how and why we achieved these models
            Act like the audience has never heard of any of this before, even if it makes sense to us.
      Paper can be as long as necessary, but it needs to be clear, concise and interesting to read as the professor.

To do: 
  - Spit into 2 groups and collect data for each proposal
  - Have a meeting on this monday (November 18th) to discuss which proposal we should advance our projects with.

  After we have finalized our proposal, we will also discuss how each group member can contribute to the advancement of the assignment
      We present first, so we need to be on top of this assignment.

  We got this!
